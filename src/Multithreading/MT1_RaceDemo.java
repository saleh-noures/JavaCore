package Multithreading;

/*
 *  Threads are independent paths of code execution that run concurrently in a Java program. Your application can use threads to multitask: perform time-intensive tasks and run them in the background.
 *  This allows the application to remain responsive to users.
 * 1- A thread is a light-weight smallest part of a process that can run concurrently with the other parts(other threads) of the same process.
 * 2- Threads are independent because they all have separate path of execution that is the reason if an exception occurs in one thread, it doesnï¿½t affect the execution of other threads.
 * 3- All threads of a process share the common memory.
 * 4- The process of executing multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading
 * 5- The main purpose of multithreading is to provide simultaneous execution of two or more parts of a program to maximum utilize the CPU time
 * 6- A thread can be in one of the following states: NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED. See thread States image
 * 7- Thread scheduler in the JVM negotiates threads execution with the CPU and nothing can be guarantee about which thread should be executed at a particular point of time.
 * 8- By default threads share same objects (Not Sure!! but probably this is true with Runnable objects and false when overriding the run method in Thread class )
 *    This Example From http://java9s.com/?s=Multithreading
 * 9- The difference between Callable and Runnable classes
 * 		Callable is introduced in JDK 5.0 but Runnable is introduced in JDK 1.0
 * 		Callable has call() method but Runnable has run() method.
 * 		Callable has call method which returns value but Runnable has run method which doesn't return any value.
 * 		call method can throw checked exception but run method can't throw checked exception.
 * 		Callable use submit() method to put in task queue but Runnable use execute() method to put in the task queue.
