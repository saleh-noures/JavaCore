 Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree
 Spanning Tree:
  Is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges.
 Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected..

 Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
 In a weighted graph, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has minimum weight than all other spanning
 trees of the same graph. In real-world situations, this weight can be measured as distance, congestion, traffic
 load or any arbitrary value denoted to the edges.
